## 📊 Competition Analysis

### Key Dates
- ✅ **Registration closes**: November 14, 2025
- ⏰ **Predictive Phase (Zero-Shot) begins**: December 1, 2025 (~5 weeks away)
- **Submission deadline**: TBD (likely Jan 2026)

### Evaluation Criteria
**"Strength of correlation of property predictions to experimentally measured properties"**

🎯 **Critical Insight**: Winning depends on **correlation (Spearman/Pearson ρ)**, NOT absolute accuracy!
- Rank order matters more than exact values
- Relative scoring between variants is key
- Consistent differentiation across all three properties

### Properties to Predict
1. **Activity** (PET degradation rate/efficiency)
2. **Thermostability** (Tm or thermal resistance)
3. **Expression** (soluble expression level)

7. **Abstract writing**
   - Emphasize literature-driven priors (unique!)
   - Cite zero-shot validation (ProteinGym)
   - Highlight ensemble approach

8. **Code cleaning & GitHub**
   - Clean repository structure
   - Add competition-specific README
   - Ensure reproducibility

9. **Final validation**
   - Run on all test sequences

## 🚀 Immediate Action Items (Next 24 Hours)

### 1. FoldX Integration - PRIORITY #1

**Goal**: Add real ΔΔG stability predictions

**Implementation**:
```python
# src/features/ddg_foldx.py
def ddg_foldx_scores(seqs, cfg):
    # 1. Get reference PDB (IsPETase 5XJH or AlphaFold2)
    # 2. Generate mutation files for each variant
    # 3. Run FoldX BuildModel
    # 4. Parse ΔΔG from output
    # 5. Return {seq_id: ddg_score}
```

**Files to modify**:
- `src/features/ddg_foldx.py` (implement wrapper)
- `config.yaml` (enable use_ddg_foldx: true)
- `tests/test_ddg.py` (add tests)

**Expected improvement**:
- Stability correlation: 0.3 → 0.6-0.7 (Spearman ρ)

### 2. ProteinGym Benchmark - PRIORITY #2

**Goal**: Validate and tune on external dataset

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Download ProteinGym DMS data
wget https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/proteingym/DMS_ProteinGym_substitutions.zip

# Extract PETase-related assays
# Run pipeline on benchmark set
# Calculate Spearman correlation
# Tune weights to maximize ρ
```

**Expected outcome**:
- Know our actual ranking potential
- Optimized weights for competition metric
