## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-plm.txt  # For ESM2 protein language models
```

### 2. Run Predictions

```bash
python -m src.cli \
  --input data/input/sequences.fasta \
  --outdir data/output \
  --config config.yaml
```

### 3. Get Results

Output file: `data/output/predictions.csv`

```csv
seq_id,activity_score,stability_score,expression_score
FAST_PETase,0.9085,0.6950,1.0000
variant_002,0.8852,1.0000,0.7833
```

**Final Score Calculation:**
```
final_score = activity_score × 0.50 + stability_score × 0.30 + expression_score × 0.20
```

## Competition Usage

### One-Click Runner

```bash
python run_competition.py data/competition/input.fasta data/competition/output
```

This will:
1. Run multi-channel predictions
2. Calculate weighted final scores
3. Generate ranked `SUBMISSION.csv`

See [COMPETITION_GUIDE.md](COMPETITION_GUIDE.md) for detailed competition workflow.

## System Architecture

### Multi-Channel Design

Our zero-shot prediction combines **three independent channels**:

#### 1. **PLM Channel** (ESM2 Protein Language Model)
- Model: `facebook/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D`
- Method: Pseudo-likelihood scoring of mutations
- Predicts: Sequence plausibility from evolutionary patterns
- Weight: 50% activity + 10% stability

#### 2. **FoldX Channel** (Physical Energy Calculations)
- Tool: FoldX 5.1 BuildModel
- Method: ΔΔG calculation (free energy change upon mutation)
- Predicts: Protein thermostability from physical force fields
- Weight: 35% stability
- **Status: Fully integrated and validated** ✓

#### 3. **Priors Channel** (Biophysical Features)
- Features: Disorder (IUPred3), conservation, charge, hydrophobicity
- Method: Rule-based heuristics for protein quality
- Predicts: Expression likelihood, aggregation propensity
- Weight: 15% stability + 20% expression

### Scoring Weights (config.yaml)

```yaml
weights:
  activity: 0.50           # PLM likelihood
  stability:
    ddg_foldx: 0.35        # Physical ΔΔG
    plm_perplexity: 0.10   # Sequence plausibility
    priors: 0.15           # Biophysical features
  expression: 0.20         # Disorder, solubility
```

## Key Features

✅ **Zero-shot prediction** — No training data required
✅ **Physical validation** — FoldX ΔΔG calculations for real stability estimates
✅ **GPU acceleration** — ESM2 inference on CUDA (auto-fallback to CPU)
✅ **Robust scoring** — Median/MAD normalization + rank-average fusion
✅ **Graceful degradation** — Continues with available channels if tools missing
✅ **Competition-ready** — Validated with FAST_PETase as top variant

---

## Validation Results

### Test Case: Real PETase Variants

Input: 6 known PETase variants (FAST_PETase, WT, engineered mutants)

**Result:**
```
Rank 1: FAST_PETase (final_score: 0.9085)  ← Known best variant ✓
  Activity:   0.9085 (ESM2 likelihood)
  Stability:  0.6950 (FoldX ΔΔG: +2.72 kcal/mol)
  Expression: 1.0000 (low disorder, stable)
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:

```yaml
# Enable/disable channels
use_plm_esm: true
use_ddg_foldx: true     # ⚠️ Requires WSL on Windows
use_disorder: true

# Model settings
plm:
  model_name: facebook/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D
  device: auto          # auto, cuda, cpu

# FoldX settings
foldx:
  exe: tools/foldx/foldx_wsl.bat
  pdb: tools/foldx/5XJH.pdb
  chain: A
  timeout: 60
```

## Troubleshooting

### FoldX Issues

**Problem**: FoldX not found or execution fails
**Solution**:
- Windows users: Install WSL (`wsl --install`)
- Place Linux FoldX binary in `tools/foldx/foldx_20251231`
- Ensure PDB file `5XJH.pdb` exists in `tools/foldx/`

**Problem**: Mutations outside PDB range
**Solution**: FoldX PDB covers residues 30-292. Out-of-range mutations are automatically filtered with warnings.

### GPU Issues

**Problem**: CUDA out of memory
**Solution**: Set `plm.device: cpu` in `config.yaml`, or reduce batch size

**Problem**: ESM2 model not found
**Solution**: First run downloads ~3GB model from HuggingFace Hub. Requires internet connection.

### Performance

- **Speed**: ~30 seconds/variant on GPU, ~3 minutes/variant on CPU
- **Memory**: ~8GB RAM + 4GB VRAM (GPU mode)
- **Bottleneck**: FoldX ΔΔG calculation (~20 seconds/variant)
