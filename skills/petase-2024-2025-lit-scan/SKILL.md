description: "Use PubMed & Scholar Gateway to extract PETase (and PET hydrolase) variants and effects from 2024–2025 papers into a standardized table with citations."
version: "1.0.0"

# Goal
Create a **2024–2025 PETase variants & effects** evidence table using **PubMed** and **Scholar Gateway** connectors, with strict, citable provenance.

# When to use
- The user asks for PETase or PET hydrolase variant scouting, benchmarking, or zero-shot hypothesis generation focused on **2024–2025**.

# Operating rules
1. **Always use connectors** (PubMed first; Scholar Gateway for Wiley/paywalled content). Prefer **PMC** for full text when available.
2. Restrict the search window to **2024-01-01 .. 2025-10-21**.
3. For each paper, extract **mutations**, **assay comparability**, **performance endpoints**, **thermostability**, **expression notes**, **rationale**, and **citations**.
4. **Deduplicate by DOI**; include PMID/PMCID when present.
5. Use the **Output schema** exactly (see `resources/output-schema.csv`).

# Query seeds
(See `resources/query-strings.md` for adaptable queries.)

# Output format
- Primary: table matching the schema (CSV in a fenced code block).
- Secondary: ranked shortlist (5–10 variants) + zero-shot hypotheses.

# Steps
1. Search PubMed with Boolean + fielded queries; filter 2024–2025; sort by date.
2. For promising records, fetch abstracts/full text (PMC if available). Cross-check in Scholar Gateway to access Wiley content.
3. Extract data into the schema; convert/standardize units carefully.
4. Deduplicate by DOI; verify all rows have **at least one** citation (PMID/PMCID/DOI).
5. Produce the CSV table, then a ranked shortlist and 2–3 hypotheses.

# Safety & provenance
- Cite rigorously (PMID/PMCID/DOI). No hallucinated values.
- If a metric is missing, leave it blank.
- Do not train or store proprietary datasets; this is a **literature-only** workflow suitable for **Zero‑Shot** reasoning.
